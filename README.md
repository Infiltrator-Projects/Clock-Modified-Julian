# Modified Julian Date Clock

**InfiltratorOS clock resource** · **Stable ID:** `modified-julian` · **Module:** `Modified Julian Date Clock.so`

Modified Julian Date computed from native timestamp precision.

**Historical scope/accuracy:** Its epoch/day-number origin differs from ordinary Julian Date.

**Intended installation:** `/System/Resources/Clocks/Modified Julian Date Clock.so` (case-sensitive)

The clock owns both its notation and next-visible-tick scheduling. It does not require user-supplied geographic coordinates for its stated model. Elapsed-duration calculations in Common do not provide a fallback absolute clock-face implementation.

## Status

**Source copied and build verified.** This repository contains the implementation of `modified-julian`, the supporting code it needs, a one-provider `Makefile` and focused regression fixtures. The copy is based on Common 1.19.78 at `8d60662114e3`; the original Common source remains unchanged.

Run `make` to produce `build/Modified Julian Date Clock.so` and `make check` to run this provider's checks. No Common checkout or Common archive is required. The current combined Common package and its installation ownership remain in place; this copy does not introduce an independent installer or release.

See [source provenance and build details](SOURCE.md), [source manifest](SOURCE-MANIFEST.json) and [recorded validation](VALIDATION-RESULTS.json).

## Independent forensic audit

See [audit findings](docs/FORENSIC-AUDIT.md) for corrections, numerical-model limits and unresolved authority disagreements. A successful build is not a historical-accuracy certificate.
