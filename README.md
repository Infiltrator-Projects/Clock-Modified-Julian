# Modified Julian Date Clock

**InfiltratorOS clock resource** · **Stable ID:** `modified-julian` · **Module:** `Modified Julian Date Clock.so`

Modified Julian Date computed from native timestamp precision.

**Historical scope/accuracy:** Its epoch/day-number origin differs from ordinary Julian Date.

**Intended installation:** `/System/Resources/Clocks/Modified Julian Date Clock.so` (case-sensitive)

The clock owns both its notation and next-visible-tick scheduling. It does not require user-supplied geographic coordinates for its stated model. Elapsed-duration calculations in Common do not provide a fallback absolute clock-face implementation.

## Status

**Documentation-only:** The runnable provider, tests, current combined resource packaging and release process are still in Libraries/Common. This new repository has not yet been populated with executable source, standalone tests, an installer, or a verified release.

This repository is intended to become an independently buildable, testable and installable provider, not a duplicate application-specific implementation. Calendar, Files, System Settings and compatible consumers discover executable providers through Common.
