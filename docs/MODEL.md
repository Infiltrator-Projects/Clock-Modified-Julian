# Modified Julian Date Clock — computational and historical model

| Field | Value |
| --- | --- |
| Stable provider ID | `modified-julian` |
| Resource kind | `clock` |
| Canonical compiled name | `Modified Julian Date Clock.so` |
| Intended installation | `/System/Resources/Clocks/Modified Julian Date Clock.so` |

## Maintained model

Modified Julian Date computed from native timestamp precision.

## Historical scope / fidelity limitation

**Implemented interpretation:** Modified Julian Date.

**Fidelity boundary:** Its epoch/day-number origin differs from ordinary Julian Date.

This is an account of the implemented model, not a claim that a particular mathematical projection was observed or officially used in every historical period. Where the source model uses approximations, retrospective continuation or external ICU/CLDR authorities, that distinction must remain explicit.

## Observable behaviour

The clock owns both its notation and next-visible-tick scheduling. It does not require user-supplied geographic coordinates for its stated model. Elapsed-duration calculations in Common do not provide a fallback absolute clock-face implementation.

## Unsupported inputs and reproducibility

Missing providers are unavailable; consumers must not substitute a different provider with a similar name. Malformed or out-of-range inputs must return an explicit failure without modifying outputs. Module metadata must convey its true ID and kind, independent of filename ordering.

## Provenance

The model and boundary above are documented from the current resource build map, Calendar model matrix and Common historical-fidelity audit. They have not yet been independently requalified in this repository.
